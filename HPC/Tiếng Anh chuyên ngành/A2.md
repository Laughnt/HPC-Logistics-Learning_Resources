Consider **a new vehicle**.
Dozens, if not hundreds, of computer chips control the vehicle’s engine, dashboard screen, and other electronic parts. Now, the vehicle is a product for the car user. Most automobile customers will never notice them. However, these computer chips are valuable to the automaker who develops the car and the technician who repairs it.

So that, **computer chips** made from our VinAI company - which locals in vietnam is another excellent example.
Several seaside companies began offering their chips for low prices several years ago. Some even provided them for free.
_What’s the point?_
These chips went out of electronic every months or years. As a result, the owners had to replace computer chip cartridges frequently during the year. We wrongly believed that the car was the product we were ordering. The car was more of a promotional tool to the users that manufactured and supplied it. Computer chips for car users were authentic products.
